# FlxAnimate

A way to introduce texture atlases through your flixel projects.
Run `haxelib install https://github.com/Dot-Stuff/flxanimate.git` to install FlxAnimate.

FlxAnimate introduces a way to add single animations through the texture atlas from the Adobe Animate, making the animations be more modifiable through the png so instead of the whole animation stamped in sheets, it's a recap of all the drawings which will be used for the animation later on.
Right now it's in development, so it's very possible the name functions, variables and/or classes will change on the future.

FlxAnimate only supports
  - Openfl with lime and Flixel
  - Optimized texture sheets
  - Graphics and only spritemap1

## Version which is supported
The Animate version which is tested and supported is 21, We actually don't know if it works on another versions so if you don't have that version, Please check if it works on your texture atlas, if it doesn't open an issue remarking what's the issue and the Adobe Animate that you use.

## TODO
* Test Animate versions besides 21.
* Add MovieClip and Buttons.
* Add Unoptimized export
* Add spritemap2, spritemap3 etc
