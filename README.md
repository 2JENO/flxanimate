# FlxAnimate

Run `haxelib install https://github.com/Dot-Stuff/flxanimate.git` to install FlxAnimate.

A way to introduce texture atlases through your flixel projects.

FlxAnimate introduces a way to add single animations through the texture atlas from the Adobe Animate, making the animations be more modifiable through the png so instead of the whole animation stamped in sheets, it's a recap of all the drawings which will be used for the animation later on.
Right now it's in development, so it's very possible the name functions, variables and/or classes will change on the future.

FlxAnimate only supports
  - Openfl Flixel
  - Optimized texture sheets
  - Graphics and only spritemap1

## TODO
* Test Animate versions besides 21.
* Add 2018 Adobe Animate support.
* Add MovieClip and Buttons.
* Add Unoptimized export.
* Add spritemap2, spritemap3 etc.
* Fix debug being laggy.
